<h1 style="color: #e29b30">Why did we even bother?</h1>
<div style="font-size: larger;">
<div>Sticky Notes and Work Books have been some of the only tools available to a DM to keep track of non-combat NPCs. Just because they aren’t combat oriented, doesn’t mean they aren’t worth something. We all dream of having every NPC come to life, but dread the workload involved.</div>
<p />
<div>We’ve all been there. The players derailed the campaign, ended up somewhere, and you need to create a new NPC to fill in the gaps. Here comes Guard. The players ask “what’s his name”, you silently curse and respond with despair “Bob…” This is the 9th Bob The Guard they’ve met among a sea of Steve, Tom, Jack, Dick and Harry’s.</div>
<p />
<div>Once the session is over, you’ve forgotten all about him, unless he played a crucial role. Sometimes, you look back longing, and thinking “What was this NPC called? I kind of wish I hadn’t discarded him”. The players don’t remember, so Bob The Guard #9 is now Steve The Guard #18. Wouldn’t it be awesome if you could remember? Wouldn’t it be awesome if you could easily and quickly create "Insert Unique Name" The Guard?</div>
<p />
<div>This is where the creation of this app comes from. I had an Excel File with 15 sheets keeping track of all my NPCs. Managing them was very hectic. I sat down, and decided: there must be a better way. While there are much more powerful tools available, I find they are too convoluted for the target of this. Simple, straight, just as Michael Scott intended.</div>
